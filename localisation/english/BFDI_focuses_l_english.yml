 WGF_focus_our_situation_desc: "The previously calm Goiky has now plunged into chaos, and our position in this madness is unenviable. The banner of socialism now bears only a small fragment in the north-west of Goiky, surrounded everywhere by traitors and counter-revolution. The obvious fact is the inevitable spread of the dictatorship of the proletariat throughout the continent, but for now the revolution must go on the defensive and take a good look at its situation and surroundings."

 WGF_focus_development_of_theory_desc: "Without good theory there can be no practice.

 WGF_focus_investigation: "Investigation"

 WGF_focus_socialist_army: "Red army"

 GGR_focus_snowy_identity: "Snowy Identity"
 GGR_focus_snowy_identity_desc: "It is undeniable that the objects of the Snowy Plateau are distinguished by a special unity and cultural ties, which no other region of Goiky can boast of. We must maintain the unity of our nation at all costs and spread it."
 
 GGR_focus_einheitstadt: "§REinheitstadt§!"
 GGR_focus_einheitstadt_desc: "The snowy plateau is in a sad state: Low population density and backward industry hit the unity of the snowy objects very hard, and this is compounded by the southern national traitors and forest anarchists who appeared due to distrust of our government. A number of 'policies' will be undertaken to unite the people of the Snowy Plains."
 
 GGR_focus_fight_against_anarchy: "Fight against Anarchy"
 GGR_focus_fight_against_anarchy_desc: "Although on paper maps the Snowy Forest is part of our territory, in reality 'illegal authorities' have been operating there for a long time.

To achieve this result, we need grassroots political activity of the masses, which is why propaganda is one of our first moves."
 
 GGR_focus_our_way: "Third Way"
 GGR_focus_our_way_desc: "The economy of pre-anarchist Goiky was a random, inarticulate chaos under the boot of the fifth column from Casland. We need our own economic model that will reflect the great unity of the Snow Plateau objects."

 GGR_focus_industrialization_desc: "No matter how hard it is to admit it, the Plateau is one of the poorest regions of modern Goiky.

 GGR_focus_wrong_objects: "'Wrong' Objects"
 GGR_focus_wrong_objects_desc: "The essence of the elite of Goiky society has been known for a long time. Objects without upper limbs, small and weak, not only live at the expense of the workers, but also form secret fifth columns, with the help of which they control the objects under their control, pretending to be 'weak and innocent'. All of Old Goiky was imbued with this disgusting spirit, and it hit the Snowy Plateau hard.
