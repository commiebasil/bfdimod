So far, the crisis of the cabinet has not reached a large scale, but it's moving towards it very quickly, and if nothing is done, then it is quite possible that, one might say, the 'only legitimate' government of Goiky will collapse and the largest cities of the continent will again sink into anarchy."

In the south of the Snowy Plateau, known as 'the forests', the anarchist communes declared the Free Territory from the Snowmount River to the outskirts of the Snowy Forest, where everyone who did not accept the fascist dictatorship began to flock. The settlements here exist autonomously and equally, and they solve national issues at the so-called 'settlement meeting'. So far, the main task of the anarchists is to protect against the attempts of the northern neighbor to return the forests 'to their native harbor', but tales of heroic objects that resist tyranny with all their might already go beyond the snowy plateau..."
