 #GOIKY
 GOI_event.1.t: "Battle For Dream Island"
 GOI_event.1.desc: "BFDI, or Battle For Dream Island, is an internet show in which various objects compete for the ultimate prize - an Island with a hotel, two restaurants and other amenities. Recently, it is gaining more and more popularity. But this show is far from the only thing that happens in the lands of Goiky. This continent is densely populated with various other objects and as a whole is a strong economic and social entity."
 GOI_event.1.a: "In the suspense."
 
 GOI_event.2.t: "Final-Four"
 GOI_event.2.desc: "With the elimination of Spongy, there are only four possible winners left: Firey, Leafy, Flower and Bubble. The passions around the show continue to run high and it even causes serious political unrest on the continent, which is very rare in these places."
 GOI_event.2.a: "Many won't like the winner."
 
 GOI_event.3.t: "Final Results"
 GOI_event.3.desc: "The votes are counted, possible stuffing is prevented, and in the end ... Firey came out the winner! Behind him in second place was Leafy, narrowly behind in the number of votes. The results have already been published, and the reaction of the public is not yet clear."
 GOI_event.3.a: "Well it looks like this is the end."
 
 GOI_event.4.t: "Celebrations"
 GOI_event.4.desc: "On the occasion of Firey's victory, celebrations were held on the Dream Island. At this time, the continental Goiky was torn apart by political conflicts. Simple dissatisfaction with the winner began to develop into real political manifestations and rallies. But the riots will go away on their own, right?"
 GOI_event.4.a: "Giant is awakening."
 
 GOI_event.5.t: "Island... Dissapeared?"
 GOI_event.5.desc: "No, it can't be. A couple of hours ago, Dream Island just... Disappeared? From him the trace has caught cold. The place, which used to be the mecca of Goiky, now reminds of itself only with enclosing walls against which water beats."
 GOI_event.5.a: "..."
 
 GOI_event.6.t: "Protests turn into uprisings!"
 GOI_event.6.desc: "So, the conditionally unified Goiky very quickly plunges into the abyss of anarchy. On the outskirts of the continent, local governments are already being proclaimed. Looks like this is the end..."
 GOI_event.6.a: "The future is hazy."
 
 GOI_event.7.t: "Report"
 GOI_event.7.desc: "'...The most hopeless objects were the last to leave the city; Without legs and arms, with cracks, bent, and others mutilated by this dark time. All recovery centers were destroyed or were under the control of bandits, and it was impossible to provide any clear help to these unfortunate people. The evacuation was carried out in a hurry and very unorganized, especially on the final waves, for example: in the eastern outskirts, 17 trucks were lost on the road on the 20th alone, 10 of them were stolen by local bandits, and 7 were burned. Slightly better situation in the north...'"
 GOI_event.7.a: "Interesting excerpt."
 
 GOI_event.8.t: "Battle for Goiky"
 GOI_event.8.desc: "This is where our story begins. First, you need to choose one of the many fragments of Goiky, which you will lead to greatness.\n\n§RWE STRICTLY RECOMMEND TO PAUSE THE GAME!§!"
 GOI_event.8.a: "Let's go!"
 #NGRF
 WGF_event.1.t: "Revolutionary front"
 WGF_event.1.desc: "It’s surprising, because just a couple of months ago he won the vote, he was supposed to get the island, but today he’s here. Firey often wondered where fate had taken him. In general, he changed dramatically during the days of the front. Where's Leafy? Where did the island go? These questions have not bothered him for a long time. The liberation of Goiky's objects became the main task of his existence. The short-lived relationship with Coiny quickly broke down when this traitor abandoned the cause of liberating the workers and fled to the east. But it’s okay, all the enemies of the revolution will get what they deserve."
 WGF_event.1.a: "The fire won't go out."
 
 WGF_event.2.t: "Case #8"
 WGF_event.2.desc: "CONCLUSION ON CASE #8 ABOUT THE MISSING OF D.I.:\nAfter the research work carried out described on page 9 of this document and hearings of witnesses, Leafy’s guilt in the loss of people’s property, which led to particularly large economic losses, becomes undeniable. A court hearing in the case will take place in the next few months."
 WGF_event.2.a: "Let it be so."
 
 WGF_event.3.t: "Trial"
 WGF_event.3.desc: "'...Thus, despite the absence of the accused at the trial, the evidence base of the prosecution is sufficient and indisputable to convict the accused under Articles 14.1, 16 and 51 of the legislation of the socialist republic, the revolutionary court pronounces a sentence..."
 WGF_event.3.a: "Death by flattening'"
 WGF_event.3.b: "Life imprisonment'"
 WGF_event.3.c: "The court will not pass a verdict."
 
 WGF_event.4.t: "Greetings from the snow plateau"
 WGF_event.4.desc: "When we began a program to establish contacts with communist organizations throughout Goiky, we did not at all expect what we found in the snow plateau. In the south, in the snowy forests, anarcho-communists led by Rocky are waging an irreconcilable struggle against the fascist regime of Snowball! Our delegates received a warm welcome and we were able to agree on cooperation with their partisan movement. The road to supply them with equipment was also chosen, incredibly difficult and long, but there can be no obstacles to solidarity with comrades in the far east."
 WGF_event.4.a: "They are heroes, although they are mistaken."
 
 WGF_event.5.t: "Offer"
 WGF_event.5.desc: "An interesting telegram arrived from the communists in the north: They offer military and technical cooperation, which is 'much needed for both our countries in these dark years'. Although the hostility of the northerners towards our regime is obvious, we will transfer the decision on the issue to the RCC."
 WGF_event.5.a: "Under pressure from the left faction, the proposal passes."
 
 WGF_event.6.t: "Looking East"
 WGF_event.6.desc: "Now that the attack on the Military District was only a matter of time, many things became clear: Coiny, during his participation in the construction of the Front, initially promoted sabotage and harmful proposals. It is also possible that he was planning a military coup. In any case, it's not that important now."
 WGF_event.6.a: "Fictitious friendship."
 
 WGF_event.7.t: "Victory!"
 WGF_event.7.desc: "The Coiny Junta has been defeated! Our border guards were successfully able to advance deep into enemy territory and capture military warehouses!"
 WGF_event.7.a: "Take everything you can carry!"
 
 WGF_event.8.t: "Defeat"
 WGF_event.8.desc: "Our offensive stalled, and as a result, the troops of the Military District launched a counteroffensive and captured some of our warehouses. This is a heavy defeat for our young armed forces and the objects of northern Goiky."
 WGF_event.8.a: "We will take revenge later"
 
 WGF_event.9.t: "Negotiations"
 WGF_event.9.desc: "Although we achieved some successes, the operation eventually floundered and the front stopped. In this regard, negotiations began and the conflict ended in a draw."
 WGF_event.9.a: "Good."
 
 WGF_event.10.t: "Signal"
 WGF_event.10.desc: "Our radio stations picked up a signal about a request for help, which came from North Goiky. We believe that this is an expedition that went there half of the year ago. Should we send a rescue ship?"
 WGF_event.10.a: "Send transport vessels to the signal."
 WGF_event.10.b: "Not really our problems."
 
 WGF_event.11.t: "Successful rescue"
 WGF_event.11.desc: "Our ships were able to successfully cross the Goyka Channel and sail to the coordinates. There we found approximately 60 objects, which were successfully transported back to the continent."
 WGF_event.11.a: "It will be interesting to listen to their stories."
 
 WGF_event.12.t: "Too late"
 WGF_event.12.desc: "Alas, when our ships sailed to the coast, we could only find a few ration packages and traces. The fate of the group is unknown."
 WGF_event.12.a: "Waste of time."
 
 WGF_event.14.t: "Coin shine"
 WGF_event.14.desc: "Gradually, border conflicts developed into full-fledged battles along the entire front line from the desert to the canal coast. Our troops are going on the offensive. The conflict has officially begun."
 WGF_event.14.a: "Steady as she goes."
 
 WGF_event.15.t: "Trial over Coiny"
 WGF_event.15.desc: "- So, accused, do you admit your guilt in war crimes against the objects of Northern Goiky and against the revolution?\n- Heck you, Firey!\nThe defendant suddenly jumped out of his seat in the court room, ran up to Firey and slapped him in the face, which was followed by a retaliatory slap. Soon they were separated."
 WGF_event.15.a: "Just like the good old days."
 
 WGF_event.16.t: "Supply chains are broken!"
 WGF_event.16.desc: "After the Fascist invasion of the Snowy Forest began, it became almost impossible to continue supplying the Anarchists. Unfortunately, we will have to stop sending rifles to these comrades."
 WGF_event.16.a: "Good luck to them."
 
 WGF_event.17.t: "Relations break with the Provisional Government"
 WGF_event.17.desc: "We received a telegram from Casland. As a result of an obviously fabricated investigation, our cells were discovered in the ranks of the local Communist Party. This was the reason for ending diplomatic relations with us."
 WGF_event.17.a: "Once we enter Casland, they won't even be able to send a surrender request?"
 #Reich
 GGR_event.1.t: "Behind the ridge"
 GGR_event.1.desc: "The Snowy Plateau is a wonderful region with beautiful objects, although it is quite poor. It has some features, for example: Its population, due to its isolation, is quite united and has a uniform, special culture, unlike other regions of South Goyka. It is particularly autonomous and does not depend so much on foreign trade..."
 GGR_event.1.a: "This land needs in a strong hand."
 
 GGR_event.2.t: "Snowy status-quo"
 GGR_event.2.desc: "'Death to anarchists!' - This is where Snowball ended his speech to the fighters of the newly created militia. Doubts accumulated in him and, as if he himself, rolled into a big snowball. Anarchists occupy village after village, and his popular support is small. But he knew one thing for sure:"
 GGR_event.2.a: "Our spirit cannot be broken."
 
 GGR_event.3.t: "Wald Massacre"
 GGR_event.3.desc: "Wald, one of the few forest settlements that remained under Reich control, was subjected to an "act of retaliation" by ultranationalist battalions. According to initial data, 506 objects of all genders and ages were killed on suspicion of collaboration with the resistance. The dead were thrown into heaps and burned. Those who could not be burned were simply thrown into ditches and pits. This incident will go down in the history of the Snowy Plateau as one of the most brutal."
 GGR_event.3.a: "There are also excesses..."
 
 GGR_event.4.t: "The Final Stretch"
 GGR_event.4.desc: "Those damned anarchists, national traitors who tried to undermine the unity of the Snowy Plateau. Soon they will answer for their actions fairly, all that remains is to strike the final blow. Grassy was immersed in those thoughts that haunted his mind. He joined the local Whiteshirt squad quite a long time ago and showed exemplary discipline. He doesn't know about his promotion yet."
 GGR_event.4.a: "The hand that will end anarchy."
 
 GGR_event.5.t: "Resistance suppressed"
 GGR_event.5.desc_1: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Schneehorn region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_2: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Snowy Plains region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_3: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Snowy Hills region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_4: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Bottom Plateau region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.a: "Good work."
 
 GGR_event.6.t: "Revolutionary Front supports Anarchists resistance!"
 GGR_event.6.desc: "The Firey regime in the north, despite disagreements in state-building, managed to negotiate a supply line for equipment for the Snowy Plateau Anarchists. Although the NGRF is quite far from the Snowy Plateau geographically, it greatly raised the morale of the Anarchists in our rear."
 GGR_event.6.a: "Curse them!"
 
 GGR_event.7.t: "The Anarchist Problem"
 GGR_event.7.desc: "Not everyone agreed with our... Quite radical methods of government building, and this creates many difficulties for us. National-traitors formed into communes and took refuge in the forests in the south, almost completely controlling them. Moreover, they propagate their corrupting ideas among the objects of our great Snowy State in the northern regions. If we do not solve this problem in the coming years, the fate of the Snowy Plateau will remain in doubt."
 GGR_event.7.a: "Heil Snowball!"
 
 GGR_event.8.t: "Snowball's Notes"
 GGR_event.8.desc: "Interestingly, in the last months of the Snowy Reich, Snowball even learned to write, and kept some semblance of a 'diary'. The entries in it, in keeping with the times, became more and more hopeless every day. When first the Snow Hills and then the Northern Regions left the control of the Reich, Snowball wrote a short message for his followers. It served as a kind of 'manifesto' for the remaining forces in Schneehorn. After writing, Snowball likely went into battle with one of his elite units and died."
 GGR_event.8.a: "There was no lights out. The fight continues."
 
 GGR_event.9.t: "The danger of rebellion has been eliminated!"
 GGR_event.9.desc: "The last center of resistance in our rear has been successfully destroyed, and we can now turn our attention completely towards foreign policy."
 GGR_event.9.a: "Wonderful news."
 
 GGR_event.10.t: "Profitable destruction...?"
 GGR_event.10.desc: "A few weeks after the creation of the first concentration camp in the Snowy Hills region, one of the directors of a local manufacturing company came to Schneehorn to offer... A small contribution to the state in exchange for the free labor of concentration camp prisoners. Although segregated objects generally do not have hands, it does not hurt to force them to work."
 GGR_event.10.a: "Business is going well."
 
 GGR_event.11.t: "Some... uncertainties"
 GGR_event.11.desc: "- Why the hell is this road blocked!?\n\n- No specific reasons are given, but driving here is strictly prohibited.\n\n- I don’t care, I have an urgent meeting in Schneehorn, open this barrier immediately, otherwise you will have big problems in the Reichsordnung!\n\n- ...Sorry, sir, but I'll get myself court-martialed if I do this. This is an order from the very top.\n\nThe irritated interlocutor, completely enraged, pressed the pedal to the floor and broke through the barrier, rushing into the distance."
 GGR_event.11.a: "Open fire!"
 
 GGR_event.12.t: "Crossing the line"
 GGR_event.12.desc: "At 4 AM in the morning, our troops crossed the conventional border in the form of the Snowriver River and occupied bridgeheads in the Snowy Forest. The anarchists clearly did not expect such a quick invasion and are preparing their defense. The Battle of the Snowy Plateau begins."
 GGR_event.12.a: "Forwards!"
 
 GGR_event.13.t: "Mass desertion!"
 GGR_event.13.desc: "We are faced with a big problem: The rear and reserve units treacherously went over to the side of the enemy, having been subjected to his propaganda. This significantly impacts our rear and can lead to the destruction of the front."
 GGR_event.13.a: "Traitors!"
 
#PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
 GPG_event.1.t: "A Mess"
 GPG_event.1.desc: "Another day in the council. Another argue between Ruby and Taco over some minor issue. Expansion of the war tax, it seems?... In any case, it matters little. Week after week, the government is playing for time and is not making any decisions that could get Central Goiky out of this plight. Factionalism has affected all levels of society and Casland is in a difficult situation..."
 GPG_event.1.a: "The congress is nearing opening."
 GPG_event.1.b: "I want to know more about factions." 
 
 GPG_event.2.t: "Transitional Government"
 GPG_event.2.desc: "Represents the current government cabinet. A fairly neutral and inactive faction. In fact, the formation of a unified government of the Greeny Plains and the preservation of some stability is the merit of this faction. Its brightest and most passionate member at the moment is Clock, who heads the cabinet."
 GPG_event.2.a: "Maintaining stability is a priority."
 
 GPG_event.3.t: "Democratic Faction"
 GPG_event.3.desc: "An openly liberal organization. Its participants are aimed at the partial restoration of the anarchic economic model of Goiky, as well as the formation of a federal structure of the southern continent. This faction does not have a clear leader, but Taco, Book and Barf bag stand out the most."
 GPG_event.3.a: "(And they are also sponsored by the Alliance)"
 
 GPG_event.4.t: "Toilers Front"
 GPG_event.4.desc: "An openly revolutionary faction that has repeatedly called for armed uprisings. It has several wings, but still has a common goal - the reconstruction of the state on a popular basis. The general secretary of the faction is Ruby."
 GPG_event.4.a: "Workers of Goiky, unite!"
 
 GPG_event.5.t: "Iron Hand"
 GPG_event.5.desc: "Perhaps the most militarized faction in the entire government. Formed from many organizations of different kinds in the wake of the onset of anarchy, the faction defends conservative and reactionary positions in the government. Management takes place behind the scenes in the so-called 'Iron Three', which consists of Fanny, Pillow and Nickel."
 GPG_event.5.a: "Goiky, United and Indivisible!"
 
 GPG_event.6.t: "Clock is dead!"
 GPG_event.6.desc: "Today, an incident occurred in Casland that will affect the entire state. The leader of the government cabinet, the head of the neutral faction, Clock, died as a result of an assassination attempt by a representative of the radical wing of the democratic faction. The murder was carried out with a small hammer, which was used to break through the glass case. At the moment, the cabinet is decapitated and in prostration. Pie was temporarily chosen as acting head of the cabinet."
 GPG_event.6.a: "The crisis is getting worse."
 
 GPG_event.7.t: "The factions demand the opening of the congress!"
 GPG_event.7.desc: "The government crisis continues to worsen. In this regard, three of the four factions demanded an emergency opening of the second congress of a predetermined date to resolve issues of governance."
 GPG_event.7.a: "We have no choice."
 
 GPG_event.8.t: "Congress opening"
 GPG_event.8.desc: "The streets of Casland are guarded, the council building is prepared, everything is ready for the start of the faction meeting. The most pressing issues will be resolved one by one at the congress, at the end of which stability should be achieved."
 GPG_event.8.a: "It's time to get ready!"
 
 GPG_event.9.t: "Clock question"
 GPG_event.9.desc: "So, the first issue that the congress must resolve will be the assassination attempt on the head of the cabinet. It is not yet completely clear whether there was someone larger behind the left-wing democratic activist. The congress must decide on an investigation, however, we can play with the facts a little and blame the communists and democrats for this, which will affect their positions in the council."
 GPG_event.9.a: "Obviously, it was the communists."
 GPG_event.9.b: "...This anarchist acted on his own, we'll not talk idle words."

 GPG_event.10.t: "Communists and Democrats deny their involvement!"
 GPG_event.10.desc: "As a result of an independent investigation, it turned out that the raider who killed the head of the cabinet did not even have a party card and called himself a democrat with no reason. It is also obvious that he has mental disorders. But this no longer matters, because the communists launched a counterattack and accused the current government of deliberate provocations."
 GPG_event.10.a: "Fries tried to dispute the accusation, but he had nothing to answer."
 
 GPG_event.11.t: "Chairman question"
 GPG_event.11.desc: "The second topic of the congress will be the acting head of the cabinet. It's no secret that Pie is not very suitable for this role. Fries announced his candidacy for this post. What will the council say?"
 GPG_event.11.a: "Fries passes!"
 GPG_event.11.b: "Pie managed to defend her post."
 
 GPG_event.12.t: "Island question"
 GPG_event.12.desc: "Like nothing else in Casland, the question now is about the funds that were spent on the construction of Dream Island. Huge amounts of money disappeared into thin air, and this dealt a severe blow to the economic heart of the continent. The agenda of the congress included the issue of partial payment of compensation to investors. Many consider this a necessary measure, but there is also an opinion that Goiky’s economy will be able to recover its wounds on its own, and the payment of compensation will cut into an already incredibly small budget. What will Congress choose?"
 GPG_event.12.a: "Immediate compensations!"
 GPG_event.12.b: "Congress rejects the proposal."
 
 GPG_event.13.t: "Defense question"
 GPG_event.13.desc: "While the republic is in a state of crisis, it is necessary to ensure its security from external threats. This is precisely the question that was raised at the congress. It was decided to allocate part of the budget for the construction of defensive lines on the external borders. But these funds are clearly not enough to ensure strong defense in all areas. The congress must choose a priority direction."
 GPG_event.13.a: "The railway in the north should be protected."
 GPG_event.13.b: "Mining facilities in the east should be protected."
 GPG_event.13.c: "Radicals in the south pose the greatest threat."
 
 GPG_event.14.t: "Casland question"
 GPG_event.14.desc: "After the creation of the government, a collective decision was made to ban the actions of military organizations and the admission of army units into the city. But today many are raising the question of sending troops into the city to maintain order. We can accept this decision, but it will cause furious protest from many assessors."
 GPG_event.14.a: "No!"
 GPG_event.14.b: "First state patrol enters Casland with fanfare."
 
 GPG_event.15.t: "Mines question"
 GPG_event.15.desc: "Representatives of the Labor Front demanded that the government nationalize mines in the eastern part of the country that were destroyed after the crisis in order to save them. The adoption of this proposal may cause serious protests from other factions. How will the congress proceed?"
 GPG_event.15.a: "Accept."
 GPG_event.15.b: "Let them figure it out for themselves."
 
 GPG_event.16.t: "Constitution question"
 GPG_event.16.desc: "Since the creation of the republic, it has been drowning in anarchy and legislative chaos. The time has come. All factions are talking about this, the cabinet is talking about this, and now, finally, the question has been raised. A draft constitution was put forward, developed by representatives from all four factions."
 GPG_event.16.a: "Long live the republic!"
 GPG_event.16.b: "§RThe congress decides to postpone the constitution...§!"
 
 GPG_event.17.t: "Factions vote on the constitution!"
 GPG_event.17.desc: "Despite the government's decision, factions still continue to vote for the constitution, boycotting the cabinet's decision. Ultimatums are already beginning to be put forward to the government for its immediate adoption."
 GPG_event.17.a: "Just ignore them."
 
 GPG_event.18.t: "Communists and Democrats leaving the council!"
 GPG_event.18.desc: "The refusal to adopt the constitution led to mass protests by the meeting of these two factions, as a result of which a decision was made to leave and boycott the congress. In such conditions, the council can no longer continue its work."
 GPG_event.18.a: "We can do without them."
 
 GPG_event.19.t: "Armed uprisings!"
 GPG_event.19.desc: "As a result of the collapse of the congress and the disunity of factions, uprisings began throughout the state: Right-wing mobilize armed forces, communist party activists take control of the mines, and so on. In this regard, martial law was declared and the council ceased its work."
 GPG_event.19.a: "The end of the republic."
 
 GPG_event.20.t: "Collapse"
 GPG_event.20.desc: "As a result of the crisis of local democracy, the outskirts broke away from the central government and declared their goal to take Casland. The battle for future of Goiky is taking place here."
 GPG_event.20.a: "Provisional government will restore stability!"
 GPG_event.20.b: "Workers of Goiky, unite!"
 GPG_event.20.c: "Democrats will restore the republic!"
 GPG_event.20.d: "The Iron Hand will establish order!"
 
 GPG_event.21.t: "Coup!"
 GPG_event.21.desc: "The Iron Hand, taking advantage of its special position in the armed forces, with the help of police garrisons in Casland, managed to take control of the city almost without resistance! The government fled to the west, and this probably means the collapse of the council and government cabinet."
 GPG_event.21.a: "Oh my bakery!"
 
 GPG_event.22.t: "Radicals take advantage of government weakness!"
 GPG_event.22.desc: "In a result of... not the best decisions of the congress, the popularity of the cabinet fell sharply, and radical groups took advantage of this, starting to boycott the decisions of the cabinet and challenge its position. In such conditions, the council cannot continue its work."
 GPG_event.22.a: "This will lead to dire consequences."
 
 GPG_event.23.t: "Successful completion of the congress"
 GPG_event.23.desc: "Wonderful job! The Cabinet managed to maintain stability in the state and consensus on key issues was successfully found! The Republic is moving forward, and its subjects are happy."
 GPG_event.23.a: "Forwards, Goiky!"
 
 GPG_event.24.t: "Counterattack"
 GPG_event.24.desc: "So, stability has been restored, but this is just the beginning. We have bought time, and now we need to deal with the radical opposition and do it in a way that does not cause unrest, before these radicals destabilize the state again."
 GPG_event.24.a: "We need to act quickly."
 
 GPG_event.25.t: "Arson of the council!"
 GPG_event.25.desc: "That night, a group of attackers entered the vicinity of Casland and, under the cover of darkness, entered the city center, where they set fire to the building of the Recommended Characters Council with the aim of a coup. One of them was detained with a Toilers Front party card. Our valiant police immediately took the entire administration of the Toilers Front into custody and they are awaiting trial."
 GPG_event.25.a: "It's time for judgment."

 GPG_event.26.t: "Recharnd Process"
 GPG_event.26.desc: "According to the results of the trial in Recharnd, the guilt of the communists in the arson of a state building was certainly proven. They all received sentences, and now the Labor Front is effectively decapitated."
 GPG_event.26.a: "Wonderful work."
 
 GPG_event.27.t: "Democrats uprising in the Greeny Plains!"
 GPG_event.27.desc: "The Democrats, with the support of the Greeny Plains Republic, managed to occupy the north of the country and establish their regime there. We must destroy them."
 GPG_event.27.a: "We'll deal with that."
 
 GPG_event.28.t: "Communists take control of the mines!"
 GPG_event.28.desc: "As a result of our government’s not very clever policy towards radicals, the Toilers Front faction managed to gain full support among the workers of the eastern mines and establish a socialist regime there. Now the troops are joining in."
 GPG_event.28.a: "To battle!"
 
 GPG_event.29.t: "Stormtroopers occupy Recharnd!"
 GPG_event.29.desc: "The Iron Hand, feeling complete impunity on the part of the government, decided on an armed uprising and occupied the second largest city in the country. We must crush this uprising immediately!"
 GPG_event.29.a: "Bring Recharnd back!"
 
 GPG_event.30.t: "Fries takes military command"
 GPG_event.30.desc: "The time has come to give armed resistance to the rebels. Fries takes over as military commander to protect Goiky from the radicals."
 GPG_event.30.a: "Forwards!"
 
 GPG_event.31.t: "Republic occupies Lawnland!"
 GPG_event.31.desc: "Taking advantage of the instability in government following the recent adoption of the Constitution, the Greenport government decided to introduce war into the border areas to 'protect its borders'. This is an unprecedented act of aggression, but for now there is nothing we can do."
 GPG_event.31.a: "Bastards."
 
 GPG_event.32.t: "Factions ban"
 GPG_event.32.desc: "The Second Congress continued its work as if nothing had happened. The congress was not concerned about either the bloody civil war that had passed or the absence of two-thirds of the former members. The first document adopted by the new cabinet was the ban on factionalism. After a five-minute discussion, it was signed absolutely casually, like an ordinary monthly income report, and the congress continued to calmly discuss the next issue."
