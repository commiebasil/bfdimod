 GOI_event.1.t: "Battle For Dream Island"
 GOI_event.1.desc: "BFDI, or Battle For Dream Island, is an internet show in which various objects compete for the ultimate prize - an Island with a hotel, two restaurants and other amenities. Recently, it is gaining more and more popularity. But this show is far from the only thing that happens in the lands of Goiky. This continent is densely populated with various other objects and as a whole is a strong economic and social entity."
 GOI_event.1.a: "In the suspense."
 
 GOI_event.2.t: "Final-Four"
 GOI_event.2.desc: "With the elimination of Spongy, there are only four possible winners left: Firey, Leafy, Flower and Bubble. The passions around the show continue to run high and it even causes serious political unrest on the continent, which is very rare in these places."
 GOI_event.2.a: "Many won't like the winner."
 
 GOI_event.3.t: "Final Results"
 GOI_event.3.desc: "The votes are counted, possible stuffing is prevented, and in the end ... Firey came out the winner! Behind him in second place was Leafy, narrowly behind in the number of votes. The results have already been published, and the reaction of the public is not yet clear."
 GOI_event.3.a: "Well it looks like this is the end."
 
 GOI_event.4.t: "Celebrations"
 GOI_event.4.desc: "On the occasion of Firey's victory, celebrations were held on the Dream Island. At this time, the continental Goiky was torn apart by political conflicts. Simple dissatisfaction with the winner began to develop into real political manifestations and rallies. But the riots will go away on their own, right?"
 GOI_event.4.a: "Giant is awakening."
 
 GOI_event.5.t: "Island... Dissapeared?"
 GOI_event.5.desc: "No, it can't be. A couple of hours ago, Dream Island just... Disappeared? From him the trace has caught cold. The place, which used to be the mecca of Goiky, now reminds of itself only with enclosing walls against which water beats."
 GOI_event.5.a: "..."
 
 GOI_event.6.t: "Protests turn into uprisings!"
 GOI_event.6.desc: "So, the conditionally unified Goiky very quickly plunges into the abyss of anarchy. On the outskirts of the continent, local governments are already being proclaimed. Looks like this is the end..."
 GOI_event.6.a: "The future is hazy."
 
 GOI_event.7.t: "Report"
 GOI_event.7.desc: "'...The most hopeless objects were the last to leave the city; Without legs and arms, with cracks, bent, and others mutilated by this dark time. All recovery centers were destroyed or were under the control of bandits, and it was impossible to provide any clear help to these unfortunate people. The evacuation was carried out in a hurry and very unorganized, especially on the final waves, for example: in the eastern outskirts, 17 trucks were lost on the road on the 20th alone, 10 of them were stolen by local bandits, and 7 were burned. Slightly better situation in the north...'"
 GOI_event.7.a: "Interesting excerpt."
 
 GOI_event.8.t: "Battle for Goiky"
 GOI_event.8.desc: "This is where our story begins. First, you need to choose one of the many fragments of Goiky, which you will lead to greatness.\n\n§RWE STRICTLY RECOMMEND TO PAUSE THE GAME!§!"
 GOI_event.8.a: "Let's go!"
 #NGRF
 WGF_event.1.t: "Revolutionary front"
 WGF_event.1.desc: "It’s surprising, because just a couple of months ago he won the vote, he was supposed to get the island, but today he’s here. Firey often wondered where fate had taken him. In general, he changed dramatically during the days of the front. Where's Leafy? Where did the island go? These questions have not bothered him for a long time. The liberation of Goiky's objects became the main task of his existence. The short-lived relationship with Coiny quickly broke down when this traitor abandoned the cause of liberating the workers and fled to the east. But it’s okay, all the enemies of the revolution will get what they deserve."
 WGF_event.1.a: "The fire won't go out."
 
 WGF_event.2.t: "Case #8"
 WGF_event.2.desc: "CONCLUSION ON CASE #8 ABOUT THE MISSING OF D.I.:\nAfter the research work carried out described on page 9 of this document and hearings of witnesses, Leafy’s guilt in the loss of people’s property, which led to particularly large economic losses, becomes undeniable. A court hearing in the case will take place in the next few months."
 WGF_event.2.a: "Let it be so."
 
 WGF_event.3.t: "Trial"
 WGF_event.3.desc: "'...Thus, despite the absence of the accused at the trial, the evidence base of the prosecution is sufficient and indisputable to convict the accused under Articles 14.1, 16 and 51 of the legislation of the socialist republic, the revolutionary court pronounces a sentence..."
 WGF_event.3.a: "Death by flattening'"
 WGF_event.3.b: "Life imprisonment'"
 WGF_event.3.c: "The court will not pass a verdict."
 
 WGF_event.4.t: "Greetings from the snow plateau"
 WGF_event.4.desc: "When we began a program to establish contacts with communist organizations throughout Goiky, we did not at all expect what we found in the snow plateau. In the south, in the snowy forests, anarcho-communists led by Rocky are waging an irreconcilable struggle against the fascist regime of Snowball! Our delegates received a warm welcome and we were able to agree on cooperation with their partisan movement. The road to supply them with equipment was also chosen, incredibly difficult and long, but there can be no obstacles to solidarity with comrades in the far east."
 WGF_event.4.a: "They are heroes, although they are mistaken."
 
 WGF_event.5.t: "Offer"
 WGF_event.5.desc: "An interesting telegram arrived from the communists in the north: They offer military and technical cooperation, which is 'much needed for both our countries in these dark years'. Although the hostility of the northerners towards our regime is obvious, we will transfer the decision on the issue to the RCC."
 WGF_event.5.a: "Under pressure from the left faction, the proposal passes."
 
 WGF_event.6.t: "Looking East"
 WGF_event.6.desc: "Now that the attack on the Military District was only a matter of time, many things became clear: Coiny, during his participation in the construction of the Front, initially promoted sabotage and harmful proposals. It is also possible that he was planning a military coup. In any case, it's not that important now."
 WGF_event.6.a: "Fictitious friendship."
 
 WGF_event.7.t: "Victory!"
 WGF_event.7.desc: "The Coiny Junta has been defeated! Our border guards were successfully able to advance deep into enemy territory and capture military warehouses!"
 WGF_event.7.a: "Take everything you can carry!"
 
 WGF_event.8.t: "Defeat"
 WGF_event.8.desc: "Our offensive stalled, and as a result, the troops of the Military District launched a counteroffensive and captured some of our warehouses. This is a heavy defeat for our young armed forces and the objects of northern Goiky."
 WGF_event.8.a: "We will take revenge later"
 
 WGF_event.9.t: "Negotiations"
 WGF_event.9.desc: "Although we achieved some successes, the operation eventually floundered and the front stopped. In this regard, negotiations began and the conflict ended in a draw."
 WGF_event.9.a: "Good."
 
 WGF_event.10.t: "Signal"
 WGF_event.10.desc: "Our radio stations picked up a signal about a request for help, which came from North Goiky. We believe that this is an expedition that went there half of the year ago. Should we send a rescue ship?"
 WGF_event.10.a: "Send transport vessels to the signal."
 WGF_event.10.b: "Not really our problems."
 
 WGF_event.11.t: "Successful rescue"
 WGF_event.11.desc: "Our ships were able to successfully cross the Goyka Channel and sail to the coordinates. There we found approximately 60 objects, which were successfully transported back to the continent."
 WGF_event.11.a: "It will be interesting to listen to their stories."
 
 WGF_event.12.t: "Too late"
 WGF_event.12.desc: "Alas, when our ships sailed to the coast, we could only find a few ration packages and traces. The fate of the group is unknown."
 WGF_event.12.a: "Waste of time."
 
 WGF_event.14.t: "Coin shine"
 WGF_event.14.desc: "Gradually, border conflicts developed into full-fledged battles along the entire front line from the desert to the canal coast. Our troops are going on the offensive. The conflict has officially begun."
 WGF_event.14.a: "Steady as she goes."
 
 WGF_event.15.t: "Trial over Coiny"
 WGF_event.15.desc: "- So, accused, do you admit your guilt in war crimes against the objects of Northern Goiky and against the revolution?\n- Heck you, Firey!\nThe defendant suddenly jumped out of his seat in the court room, ran up to Firey and slapped him in the face, which was followed by a retaliatory slap. Soon they were separated."
 WGF_event.15.a: "Just like the good old days."
 
 WGF_event.16.t: "Supply chains are broken!"
 WGF_event.16.desc: "After the Fascist invasion of the Snowy Forest began, it became almost impossible to continue supplying the Anarchists. Unfortunately, we will have to stop sending rifles to these comrades."
 WGF_event.16.a: "Good luck to them."

 GGR_event.1.t: "Behind the ridge"
 GGR_event.1.desc: "The Snowy Plateau is a wonderful region with beautiful objects, although it is quite poor. It has some features, for example: Its population, due to its isolation, is quite united and has a uniform, special culture, unlike other regions of South Goyka. It is particularly autonomous and does not depend so much on foreign trade..."
 GGR_event.1.a: "This land needs in a strong hand."
 
 GGR_event.2.t: "Snowy status-quo"
 GGR_event.2.desc: "'Death to anarchists!' - This is where Snowball ended his speech to the fighters of the newly created militia. Doubts accumulated in him and, as if he himself, rolled into a big snowball. Anarchists occupy village after village, and his popular support is small. But he knew one thing for sure:"
 GGR_event.2.a: "Our spirit cannot be broken."
 
 GGR_event.3.t: "Wald Massacre"
 GGR_event.3.desc: "Wald, one of the few forest settlements that remained under Reich control, was subjected to an "act of retaliation" by ultranationalist battalions. According to initial data, 506 objects of all genders and ages were killed on suspicion of collaboration with the resistance. The dead were thrown into heaps and burned. Those who could not be burned were simply thrown into ditches and pits. This incident will go down in the history of the Snowy Plateau as one of the most brutal."
 GGR_event.3.a: "There are also excesses..."
 
 GGR_event.4.t: "The Final Stretch"
 GGR_event.4.desc: "Those damned anarchists, national traitors who tried to undermine the unity of the Snowy Plateau. Soon they will answer for their actions fairly, all that remains is to strike the final blow. Grassy was immersed in those thoughts that haunted his mind. He joined the local Whiteshirt squad quite a long time ago and showed exemplary discipline. He doesn't know about his promotion yet."
 GGR_event.4.a: "The hand that will end anarchy."
 
 GGR_event.5.t: "Resistance suppressed"
 GGR_event.5.desc_1: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Schneehorn region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_2: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Snowy Plains region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_3: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Snowy Hills region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_4: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Bottom Plateau region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.a: "Good work."
 
 GGR_event.6.t: "Revolutionary Front supports Anarchists resistance!"
 GGR_event.6.desc: "The Firey regime in the north, despite disagreements in state-building, managed to negotiate a supply line for equipment for the Snowy Plateau Anarchists. Although the NGRF is quite far from the Snowy Plateau geographically, it greatly raised the morale of the Anarchists in our rear."
 GGR_event.6.a: "Curse them!"
 
 GGR_event.7.t: "The Anarchist Problem"
 GGR_event.7.desc: "Not everyone agreed with our... Quite radical methods of government building, and this creates many difficulties for us. National-traitors formed into communes and took refuge in the forests in the south, almost completely controlling them. Moreover, they propagate their corrupting ideas among the objects of our great Snowy State in the northern regions. If we do not solve this problem in the coming years, the fate of the Snowy Plateau will remain in doubt."
 GGR_event.7.a: "Heil Snowball!"
 
 GGR_event.8.t: "Snowball's Notes"
 GGR_event.8.desc: "Interestingly, in the last months of the Snowy Reich, Snowball even learned to write, and kept some semblance of a 'diary'. The entries in it, in keeping with the times, became more and more hopeless every day. When first the Snow Hills and then the Northern Regions left the control of the Reich, Snowball wrote a short message for his followers. It served as a kind of 'manifesto' for the remaining forces in Schneehorn. After writing, Snowball likely went into battle with one of his elite units and died."
 GGR_event.8.a: "There was no lights out. The fight continues."
 
 GGR_event.9.t: "The danger of rebellion has been eliminated!"
 GGR_event.9.desc: "The last center of resistance in our rear has been successfully destroyed, and we can now turn our attention completely towards foreign policy."
 GGR_event.9.a: "Wonderful news."
 
 GGR_event.10.t: "Profitable destruction...?"
 GGR_event.10.desc: "A few weeks after the creation of the first concentration camp in the Snowy Hills region, one of the directors of a local manufacturing company came to Schneehorn to offer... A small contribution to the state in exchange for the free labor of concentration camp prisoners. Although segregated objects generally do not have hands, it does not hurt to force them to work."
 GGR_event.10.a: "Business is going well."
 
 GGR_event.11.t: "Some... uncertainties"
 GGR_event.11.desc: "- Why the hell is this road blocked!?\n\n- No specific reasons are given, but driving here is strictly prohibited.\n\n- I don’t care, I have an urgent meeting in Schneehorn, open this barrier immediately, otherwise you will have big problems in the Reichsordnung!\n\n- ...Sorry, sir, but I'll get myself court-martialed if I do this. This is an order from the very top.\n\nThe irritated interlocutor, completely enraged, pressed the pedal to the floor and broke through the barrier, rushing into the distance."
 GGR_event.11.a: "Open fire!"
 
 GGR_event.12.t: "Crossing the line"
 GGR_event.12.desc: "At 4 AM in the morning, our troops crossed the conventional border in the form of the Snowriver River and occupied bridgeheads in the Snowy Forest. The anarchists clearly did not expect such a quick invasion and are preparing their defense. The Battle of the Snowy Plateau begins."
 GGR_event.12.a: "Forwards!"
 
 GGR_event.13.t: "Mass desertion!"
 GGR_event.13.desc: "We are faced with a big problem: The rear and reserve units treacherously went over to the side of the enemy, having been subjected to his propaganda. This significantly impacts our rear and can lead to the destruction of the front."
 GGR_event.13.a: "Traitors!"

According to the original version, the island was bought by Leafy, who probably hid in the evil forest.

 bfdinews.7.t: "Collapse of the Snowy Plateau!"
 bfdinews.7.desc: "Interesting news came from the Snowy Plains: The local dictatorship couldn't withstand the blows of the resistance and collapsed into fragments and self-proclaimed governments.
