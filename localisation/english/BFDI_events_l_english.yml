 #GOIKY
 GOI_event.1.t: "Battle For Dream Island"
 GOI_event.1.desc: "BFDI, or Battle For Dream Island, is an internet show in which various objects compete for the ultimate prize - an Island with a hotel, two restaurants and other amenities. Recently, it has been gaining more and more popularity. But this show is far from the only thing that happens in the lands of Goiky. This continent is densely populated with various other objects and as a whole is a strong economic and social entity."
 GOI_event.1.a: "In the suspense."
 
 GOI_event.2.t: "Final-Four"
 GOI_event.2.desc: "With the elimination of Spongy, there are only four possible winners left: Firey, Leafy, Flower and Bubble. The passion for the show continues to run high and it even causes serious political unrest on the continent, which is very rare in Goiky."
 GOI_event.2.a: "Many won't like the winner."
 
 GOI_event.3.t: "Final Results"
 GOI_event.3.desc: "The votes are counted, possible stuffing is prevented, and in the end ... Firey came out the winner! Behind him in second place was Leafy, narrowly behind in the number of votes. The results have already been published, and the reaction of the public is not yet clear."
 GOI_event.3.a: "Well it looks like this is the end."
 
 GOI_event.4.t: "Celebrations"
 GOI_event.4.desc: "On the occasion of Firey's victory, celebrations were held on Dream Island. At this time, continental Goiky was torn apart by political conflicts. Simple dissatisfaction with the winner began to develop into real political manifestations and rallies. But the riots will go away on their own, right?"
 GOI_event.4.a: "Giant is awakening."
 
 GOI_event.5.t: "Island... Dissapeared?"
 GOI_event.5.desc: "No, it can't be. A couple of hours ago, Dream Island just... Disappeared? The island, which used to be the mecca of Goiky, is now only enclosing wals and crashing waves."
 GOI_event.5.a: "..."
 
 GOI_event.6.t: "Protests turn into uprisings!"
 GOI_event.6.desc: "The conditionally unified Goiky very quickly plunges into the abyss of anarchy. On the outskirts of the continent, local governments are already being proclaimed. Looks like this is the end..."
 GOI_event.6.a: "The future is hazy."
 
 GOI_event.7.t: "Report"
 GOI_event.7.desc: "'...The most hopeless objects were the last to leave the city; Without legs and arms, with cracks, bent, and others mutilated by this dark time. All recovery centers were destroyed or were under the control of bandits, and it was impossible to provide any clear help to these unfortunate people. The evacuation was carried out in a hurry and very unorganized, especially in the final waves, for example: in the eastern outskirts, 17 trucks were lost on the road on the 20th alone, 10 of them were stolen by local bandits, and 7 were burned. Slightly better situation in the north...'"
 GOI_event.7.a: "Interesting excerpt."
 
 GOI_event.8.t: "Battle for Goiky"
 GOI_event.8.desc: "This is where our story begins. First, you need to choose one of the many fragments of Goiky, which you will lead to greatness.\n\n§RWE STRICTLY RECOMMEND TO PAUSE THE GAME!§!"
 GOI_event.8.a: "Let's go!"

 GOI_event.69.t: "Free Will!"
 GOI_event.69.desc: "To make The Great Battle for Goiky more interesting do you wish to buff the AI?"
 GOI_event.69.a: "Fine as it is."
 GOI_event.69.b: "Minor Buff."
 GOI_event.69.c: "Moderate Buff."
 GOI_event.69.d: "Major Buff."
 GOI_event.69.e: "I want to suffer!!!"

 #NGRF
 WGF_event.1.t: "Revolutionary front"
 WGF_event.1.desc: "It's surprising, because just a couple of months ago he won the vote, he was supposed to get the island, but today he's here. Firey often wondered where fate had taken him. In general, he changed dramatically during the days of the front. Where's Leafy? Where did the island go? These questions have not bothered him for a long time. The liberation of Goiky's objects became the main task of his existence. The short-lived friendship with Coiny quickly broke down when that traitor abandoned the cause of liberating the workers and fled to the east. But it's okay, all the enemies of the revolution will get what they deserve."
 WGF_event.1.a: "The fire won't go out."
 
 WGF_event.2.t: "Case #8"
 WGF_event.2.desc: "CONCLUSION ON CASE #8 ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF D.I.:\nAfter the research work carried out described on page 9 of this document and hearings of witnesses, Leafy's guilt in the loss of people's property, which led to particularly large economic losses, becomes undeniable. A court hearing in the case will take place in the next few months."
 WGF_event.2.a: "Let it be so."
 
 WGF_event.3.t: "Trial"
 WGF_event.3.desc: "'...Thus, despite the absence of the accused at the trial, the evidence base of the prosecution is sufficient and indisputable to convict the accused under Articles 14.1, 16 and 51 of the legislation of the socialist republic, the revolutionary court pronounces a sentence..."
 WGF_event.3.a: "Death by flattening'"
 WGF_event.3.b: "Life imprisonment'"
 WGF_event.3.c: "The court will not pass a verdict."
 
 WGF_event.4.t: "Greetings from the snow plateau"
 WGF_event.4.desc: "When we began a program to establish contacts with communist organizations throughout Goiky, we did not at all expect what we found in the snow plateau. In the south, in the snowy forests, anarcho-communists led by Rocky are waging an irreconcilable struggle against the fascist regime of Snowball! Our delegates received a warm welcome and we were able to agree on cooperation with their partisan movement. The road to supply them with equipment was also chosen, incredibly difficult and long, but there can be no obstacles to solidarity with comrades in the far east."
 WGF_event.4.a: "They are heroes, although they are mistaken."
 
 WGF_event.5.t: "Offer"
 WGF_event.5.desc: "An interesting telegram arrived from the communists in the north: They offer military and technical cooperation, which is much needed for both of our countries in these dark years. Although the hostility of the northerners towards our regime is obvious, we will transfer the decision on the issue to the RCC."
 WGF_event.5.a: "Under pressure from the left faction, the proposal passes."
 
 WGF_event.6.t: "Looking East"
 WGF_event.6.desc: "Now that the attack on the Military District is being prepared, many things have become clear: Coiny, during his participation in the construction of the Front, initially sabatoged the regime by passing harmful proposals. It is also possible that he was planning a military coup. In any case, it's not that important now."
 WGF_event.6.a: "Fictitious friendship."
 
 WGF_event.7.t: "Victory!"
 WGF_event.7.desc: "The Coiny Junta has been defeated! Our border guards were successfully able to advance deep into enemy territory and capture military warehouses!"
 WGF_event.7.a: "Take everything you can carry!"
 
 WGF_event.8.t: "Defeat"
 WGF_event.8.desc: "Our offensive stalled, and as a result, the troops of the Military District launched a counteroffensive and captured some of our warehouses. This is a heavy defeat for our young armed forces and the objects of northern Goiky."
 WGF_event.8.a: "We will take revenge later"
 
 WGF_event.9.t: "Negotiations"
 WGF_event.9.desc: "Although we achieved some successes, the operation eventually floundered and the front stopped. In this regard, negotiations began and the conflict ended in a draw."
 WGF_event.9.a: "Good."
 
 WGF_event.10.t: "Signal"
 WGF_event.10.desc: "Our radio stations picked up a signal about a request for help, which came from North Goiky. We believe that this is an expedition that went there half of the year ago. Should we send a rescue ship?"
 WGF_event.10.a: "Send transport vessels to the signal."
 WGF_event.10.b: "Not really our problems."
 
 WGF_event.11.t: "Successful rescue"
 WGF_event.11.desc: "Our ships were able to successfully cross the Goiky Canal and sail to the coordinates. There we found approximately 60 objects, which were successfully transported back to the continent."
 WGF_event.11.a: "It will be interesting to listen to their stories."
 
 WGF_event.12.t: "Too late"
 WGF_event.12.desc: "Alas, when our ships sailed to the coast, we could only find a few ration packages and traces. The fate of the group is unknown."
 WGF_event.12.a: "Waste of time."
 
 WGF_event.14.t: "Coin shine"
 WGF_event.14.desc: "Gradually, border conflicts developed into full-fledged battles along the entire front line from the desert to the canal coast. Our troops are going on the offensive. The conflict has officially begun."
 WGF_event.14.a: "Steady as she goes."
 
 WGF_event.15.t: "Trial over Coiny"
 WGF_event.15.desc: "- So, accused, do you admit your guilt in war crimes against the objects of Northern Goiky and against the revolution?\n- Frick you, Firey!\nThe defendant suddenly jumped out of his seat in the court room, ran up to Firey and slapped him in the face, which was followed by a retaliatory slap. Soon they were separated."
 WGF_event.15.a: "Just like the good old days."
 
 WGF_event.16.t: "Supply chains are broken!"
 WGF_event.16.desc: "After the Fascist invasion of the Snowy Forest began, it became almost impossible to continue supplying the Anarchists. Unfortunately, we will have to stop sending rifles to these comrades."
 WGF_event.16.a: "Good luck to them."
 
 WGF_event.17.t: "Relations break with the Provisional Government"
 WGF_event.17.desc: "We received a telegram from Casland. As a result of an obviously fabricated investigation, our cells were discovered in the ranks of the local Communist Party. This was the reason for ending diplomatic relations with us."
 WGF_event.17.a: "Once we enter Casland, they won't even be able to send a surrender request."
 
 WGF_event.18.t: "A gift from Casland"
 WGF_event.18.desc: "After the sad news about the falling of the socialist regime in Casland, our government didn't count on anything. But, suddenly, a report was received about defectors crossing the border from the Defense Zone. The border trespasser wrapped in rags and his accomplices offered their services to us."
 WGF_event.18.a: "Welcome."
 
 WGF_event.19.t: "Operation failure"
 WGF_event.19.desc: "The initial plan to defeat Coiny within six months failed. This is causing serious upheaval in our society and increasing distrust in the government. Our resources have been largely depleted."
 WGF_event.19.a: "We need to hurry."
 
 WGF_event.20.t: "Relations break with Greeny Plains"
 WGF_event.20.desc: "The GPSR government declared us to be 'revisionist' and severed all ties with us. This decision seems strange, but there is nothing we can do about it."
 WGF_event.20.a: "Idiots."
 
 WGF_event.21.t: "Our Situation"
 WGF_event.21.desc: "Firey had been in control over his now sovereign territory for several weeks now, however, most of his supporters didn't actually know what his ideology was like. That was going to change in just a few short hours, because Firey was making morning preparations to give a speech to his new-found subjects. He was currently sitting on a train, being transported to the building he was expected to speak at. Firey was definitely afraid of what might happen to him at the event, even one stutter could ruin his dream of a united, just Goiky. He ran through different scenarios of the things that could possibly go wrong in his head, whilst taking sips of his coffee.\nThe thoughts weighed heavily on his mind, making a slip up feel more and more inevitable.\n\nAs the train car stopped, and Firey stepped out, he saw a large crowd of objects, all around the platform the train had stopped at. All the objects seemed very excited, but for what, Firey didn't know. He started to look around the platform, wondering what they were all excited about. However, as he looked around, he soon realized that all of these people were grinning, wide-eyed, at him. He was the center of attention, people wanted to know his thoughts."
 WGF_event.21.a: "This speech will be light work for him."

 #Reich
 GGR_event.1.t: "Behind the ridge"
 GGR_event.1.desc: "The Snowy Plateau is a wonderful region with beautiful objects, although it is quite poor. It has some features, for example: Its population, due to its isolation, is quite united and has a uniform, special culture, unlike other regions of South Goiky. It is particularly autonomous and does not depend so much on foreign trade..."
 GGR_event.1.a: "This land needs in a strong hand."
 
 GGR_event.2.t: "Snowy status-quo"
 GGR_event.2.desc: "'Death to anarchists!' - This is where Snowball ended his speech to the fighters of the newly created militia. Doubts accumulated in him, as if he himself rolled into a big snowball. Anarchists occupy village after village, and his popular support is small. But he knows one thing for sure:"
 GGR_event.2.a: "Our spirit cannot be broken."
 
 GGR_event.3.t: "Wald Massacre"
 GGR_event.3.desc: "Wald, one of the few forest settlements that remained under Reich control, was subjected to an 'act of retaliation' by ultranationalist battalions. According to initial data, 506 objects of all genders and ages were killed on suspicion of collaboration with the resistance. The dead were thrown into heaps and burned. Those who could not be burned were simply thrown into ditches and pits. This incident will go down in the history of the Snowy Plateau as one of the most brutal events of our time."
 GGR_event.3.a: "There are also excesses..."
 
 GGR_event.4.t: "The Final Stretch"
 GGR_event.4.desc: "Those damned anarchists, national traitors who tried to undermine the unity of the Snowy Plateau. Soon they will answer for their actions fairly, all that remains is to strike the final blow. Grassy was immersed in those thoughts that haunted his mind. He joined the local Whiteshirt squad quite a long time ago and showed exemplary discipline. He doesn't know about his promotion yet."
 GGR_event.4.a: "The hand that will end anarchy."
 
 GGR_event.5.t: "Resistance suppressed"
 GGR_event.5.desc_1: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Schneehorn region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_2: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Snowy Plains region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_3: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Snowy Hills region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.desc_4: "We're successfully destroyed resistance in Bottom Plateau region and now region fully controlled by us."
 GGR_event.5.a: "Good work."
 
 GGR_event.6.t: "Revolutionary Front supports Anarchists resistance!"
 GGR_event.6.desc: "The Firey regime in the north, despite disagreements in state-building, managed to negotiate a supply line for equipment for the Snowy Plateau Anarchists. Although the NGRF is quite far from the Snowy Plateau geographically, it greatly raised the morale of the Anarchists."
 GGR_event.6.a: "Curse them!"
 
 GGR_event.7.t: "The Anarchist Problem"
 GGR_event.7.desc: "Not everyone agreed with our... Quite radical methods of government building, and this creates many difficulties for us. National traitors formed into communes and took refuge in the forests in the south, almost completely controlling them. Moreover, they propagate their corrupting ideas among the objects of our great Snowy State in the northern regions. If we do not solve this problem in the coming years, the fate of the Snowy Plateau will remain in doubt."
 GGR_event.7.a: "Heil Snowball!"
 
 GGR_event.8.t: "Snowball's Notes"
 GGR_event.8.desc: "Interestingly, in the last months of the Snowy Reich, Snowball even learned to write, and kept some semblance of a 'diary'. The entries in it, in keeping with the times, became more and more hopeless every day. When first the Snow Hills and then the Northern Regions left the control of the Reich, Snowball wrote a short message for his followers. It served as a kind of 'manifesto' for the remaining forces in Schneehorn. After writing, Snowball likely went into battle with one of his elite units and died."
 GGR_event.8.a: "There was no lights out. The fight continues."
 
 GGR_event.9.t: "The danger of rebellion has been eliminated!"
 GGR_event.9.desc: "The last center of resistance in our rear has been successfully destroyed, and we can now turn our attention completely towards foreign policy."
 GGR_event.9.a: "Wonderful news."
 
 GGR_event.10.t: "Profitable destruction...?"
 GGR_event.10.desc: "A few weeks after the creation of the first concentration camp in the Snowy Hills region, one of the directors of a local manufacturing company came to Schneehorn to offer... a small contribution to the state in exchange for the free labor of concentration camp prisoners. Although segregated objects generally do not have hands, it does not hurt to force them to work."
 GGR_event.10.a: "Business is going well."
 
 GGR_event.11.t: "Some... uncertainties"
 GGR_event.11.desc: "- Why the hell is this road blocked!?\n\n- No specific reasons are given, but driving here is strictly prohibited.\n\n- I don't care, I have an urgent meeting in Schneehorn, open this barrier immediately, otherwise you will have big problems in the Reichsordnung!\n\n- ...Sorry, sir, but I'll get myself court-martialed if I do this. This is an order from the very top.\n\nThe irritated driver, completely enraged, pressed the pedal to the floor and broke through the barrier, rushing into the distance."
 GGR_event.11.a: "Open fire!"
 
 GGR_event.12.t: "Crossing the line"
 GGR_event.12.desc: "At 4 AM, our troops crossed the conventional border in the form of the Snowriver River and occupied bridgeheads in the Snowy Forest. The anarchists clearly did not expect such a quick invasion and are preparing their defense. The Battle of the Snowy Plateau begins."
 GGR_event.12.a: "Forwards!"
 
 GGR_event.13.t: "Mass desertion!"
 GGR_event.13.desc: "We are faced with a big problem: The reserve units treacherously went over to the side of the enemy, having been subjected to his propaganda. This significantly impacts our rear and can lead to the destruction of the front."
 GGR_event.13.a: "Traitors!"

 GGR_event.14.t: "Aid from the Snow Fascists!"
 GGR_event.14.desc: "We received an import of guns from Großgoikysreich a few hours ago. While they claim it is for 'Crushing the Bandits', it could very easily be for larger goals we don't have the information on. Should we accept this import of rifles?"
 GGR_event.14.a: "Accept!"
 GGR_event.14.b: "Deny!"
 
#PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
 GPG_event.1.t: "A Mess"
 GPG_event.1.desc: "Another day in the council. Another arguement between Ruby and Taco over some minor issue. Expansion of the war tax, it seems? ...In any case, it matters little. Week after week, the government is buying time and is not making any decisions that could get Central Goiky out of this plight. Factionalism has affected all levels of society and Casland is in a difficult situation..."
 GPG_event.1.a: "The congress is nearing opening."
 GPG_event.1.b: "I want to know more about factions." 
 
 GPG_event.2.t: "Transitional Government"
 GPG_event.2.desc: "Represents the current government cabinet. A fairly neutral and inactive faction. In fact, the formation of a unified government of the Greeny Plains and the preservation of some stability is the merit of this faction. Its brightest and most passionate member at the moment is Clock, who heads the cabinet."
 GPG_event.2.a: "Maintaining stability is a priority."
 
 GPG_event.3.t: "Democratic Faction"
 GPG_event.3.desc: "An openly liberal organization. Its participants are aimed at the partial restoration of the anarchic economic model of Goiky, as well as the formation of a federal structure of the southern continent. This faction does not have a clear leader, but Taco, Book and Barf bag stand out the most."
 GPG_event.3.a: "(And they are also sponsored by the Alliance)"
 
 GPG_event.4.t: "Toilers Front"
 GPG_event.4.desc: "An openly revolutionary faction that has repeatedly called for armed uprisings. It has several wings, but still has a common goal - the reconstruction of the state on a popular basis. The general secretary of the faction is Ruby."
 GPG_event.4.a: "Workers of Goiky, unite!"
 
 GPG_event.5.t: "Iron Hand"
 GPG_event.5.desc: "Perhaps the most militarized faction in the entire government. Formed from many organizations of different kinds in the wake of the onset of anarchy, the faction defends conservative and reactionary positions in the government. Management takes place behind the scenes in the so-called 'Iron Three', which consists of Fanny, Pillow and Nickel."
 GPG_event.5.a: "Goiky, United and Indivisible!"
 
 GPG_event.6.t: "Clock is dead!"
 GPG_event.6.desc: "Today, an incident occurred in Casland that will affect the entire state. The leader of the government cabinet, the head of the neutral faction, Clock, died as a result of an assassination attempt by a representative of the radical wing of the democratic faction. The murder was carried out with a small hammer, which was used to break through the glass case. At the moment, the cabinet is running like a decapitated chicken. Pie was temporarily chosen as acting head of the cabinet."
 GPG_event.6.a: "The crisis is getting worse."
 
 GPG_event.7.t: "The factions demand the opening of the congress!"
 GPG_event.7.desc: "The government crisis continues to worsen. In this regard, three of the four factions demanded an emergency opening of the second congress on a predetermined date to resolve issues of governance."
 GPG_event.7.a: "We have no choice."
 
 GPG_event.8.t: "Congress opening"
 GPG_event.8.desc: "The streets of Casland are guarded, the council building is prepared, everything is ready for the start of the faction meeting. The most pressing issues will be resolved one by one at the congress, at the end of which stability should be achieved."
 GPG_event.8.a: "It's time to get ready!"
 
 GPG_event.9.t: "The Clock Question"
 GPG_event.9.desc: "So, the first issue that the congress must resolve will be the assassination attempt on the head of the cabinet. It is not yet completely clear whether there was someone larger behind the left-wing democratic activist. The congress must decide on an investigation, however, we can play with the facts a little and blame the communists and democrats for this, which will affect their positions in the council."
 GPG_event.9.a: "Obviously, it was the communists."
 GPG_event.9.b: "...This anarchist acted on his own, we'll not talk idle words."

 GPG_event.10.t: "Communists and Democrats deny their involvement!"
 GPG_event.10.desc: "As a result of an independent investigation, it turned out that the raider who killed the head of the cabinet did not even have a party card and called himself a democrat with no reason. But this no longer matters, because the communists launched a counterattack and accused the current government of deliberate provocations."
 GPG_event.10.a: "Fries tried to dispute the accusation, but he had nothing to answer."
 
 GPG_event.11.t: "The Chairman Question"
 GPG_event.11.desc: "The second topic of the congress will be the acting head of the cabinet. It's no secret that Pie is not very suitable for this role. Fries announced his candidacy for this post. What will the council say?"
 GPG_event.11.a: "Fries passes!"
 GPG_event.11.b: "Pie managed to defend her post."
 
 GPG_event.12.t: "The Island Question"
 GPG_event.12.desc: "Like nothing else in Casland, the question now is about the funds that were spent on the construction of Dream Island. Huge amounts of money disappeared into thin air, and this dealt a severe blow to the economic heart of the continent. The agenda of the congress included the issue of partial payment of compensation to investors. Many consider this a necessary measure, but there is also an opinion that Goiky's economy will be able to recover its wounds on its own, and the payment of compensation will cut into an already incredibly small budget. What will Congress choose?"
 GPG_event.12.a: "Immediate compensations!"
 GPG_event.12.b: "Congress rejects the proposal."
 
 GPG_event.13.t: "The Defense Question"
 GPG_event.13.desc: "While the republic is in a state of crisis, it is necessary to ensure its security from external threats. This is precisely the question that was raised at the congress. It was decided to allocate part of the budget for the construction of defensive lines on the external borders. But these funds are clearly not enough to ensure strong defense in all areas. The congress must choose a priority direction."
 GPG_event.13.a: "The railway in the north should be protected."
 GPG_event.13.b: "Mining facilities in the east should be protected."
 GPG_event.13.c: "Radicals in the south pose the greatest threat."
 
 GPG_event.14.t: "The Casland Question"
 GPG_event.14.desc: "After the creation of the government, a collective decision was made to ban the actions of military organizations and the admission of army units into the city. But today many are raising the question of sending troops into the city to maintain order. We can accept this decision, but it will cause furious protest from many assessors."
 GPG_event.14.a: "No!"
 GPG_event.14.b: "First state patrol enters Casland with fanfare."
 
 GPG_event.15.t: "The Mines Question"
 GPG_event.15.desc: "Representatives of the Toiler's Front demanded that the government nationalize mines in the eastern part of the country that were destroyed after the crisis in order to save them. The adoption of this proposal may cause serious protests from other factions. How will the congress proceed?"
 GPG_event.15.a: "Accept."
 GPG_event.15.b: "Let them figure it out for themselves."
 
 GPG_event.16.t: "The Constitution Question"
 GPG_event.16.desc: "Since the creation of the republic, it has been drowning in anarchy and legislative chaos. The time has come. All factions are talking about this, the cabinet is talking about this, and now, finally, the question has been raised. A draft constitution was put forward, developed by representatives from all four factions."
 GPG_event.16.a: "Long live the republic!"
 GPG_event.16.b: "§RThe congress decides to postpone the constitution...§!"
 
 GPG_event.17.t: "Factions vote on the constitution!"
 GPG_event.17.desc: "Despite the government's decision, factions still continue to vote for the constitution, boycotting the cabinet's decision. Ultimatums are already beginning to be put forward to the government for its immediate adoption."
 GPG_event.17.a: "Just ignore them."
 
 GPG_event.18.t: "Communists and Democrats leaving the council!"
 GPG_event.18.desc: "The refusal to adopt the constitution led to mass protests by the meeting of these two factions, as a result of which a decision was made to leave and boycott the congress. In such conditions, the council can no longer continue its work."
 GPG_event.18.a: "We can do without them."
 
 GPG_event.19.t: "Armed uprisings!"
 GPG_event.19.desc: "As a result of the collapse of the congress and the disunity of factions, uprisings began throughout the state: Right-wing mobilized armed forces, communist party activists take control of the mines, and so on. In this regard, martial law was declared and the council ceased its work."
 GPG_event.19.a: "The end of the republic."
 
 GPG_event.20.t: "Collapse"
 GPG_event.20.desc: "As a result of the crisis of local democracy, the outskirts broke away from the central government and declared their goal to take Casland. The battle for the future of Goiky is taking place here."
 GPG_event.20.a: "Provisional government will restore stability!"
 GPG_event.20.b: "Workers of Goiky, unite!"
 GPG_event.20.c: "Democrats will restore the republic!"
 GPG_event.20.d: "The Iron Hand will establish order!"
 
 GPG_event.21.t: "Coup!"
 GPG_event.21.desc: "The Iron Hand, taking advantage of its special position in the armed forces, with the help of police garrisons in Casland, managed to take control of the city almost without resistance! The government fled to the west, and this probably means the collapse of the council and government cabinet."
 GPG_event.21.a: "Oh my bakery!"
 
 GPG_event.22.t: "Radicals take advantage of government weakness!"
 GPG_event.22.desc: "In a result of...not the best decisions of the congress, the popularity of the cabinet fell sharply, and radical groups took advantage of this, starting to boycott the decisions of the cabinet and challenge its position. In such conditions, the council cannot continue its work."
 GPG_event.22.a: "This will lead to dire consequences."
 
 GPG_event.23.t: "Successful completion of the congress"
 GPG_event.23.desc: "Wonderful job! The Cabinet managed to maintain stability in the state and consensus on key issues was successfully found! The Republic is moving forward, and its people are happy."
 GPG_event.23.a: "Forwards, Goiky!"
 
 GPG_event.24.t: "Counterattack"
 GPG_event.24.desc: "So, stability has been restored, but this is just the beginning. We have bought time, and now we need to deal with the radical opposition and do it in a way that does not cause unrest, before these radicals destabilize the state again."

Wrench, in addition, stated that they also want to continue working with our Railing Sector, despite still not wanting to have official diplomatic relationships with any country. If we don't accept this offer, they will probably just keep the territory, and if they don't manage well, the city could fall under Bunch control."

We have ordered our soldiers to count it, and when they finish we will be sending it straight to Yellow Face himself. Isn't this great? MONEY!!\nEnd Transmission."

 YFC_event.6.desc: "With our friends to the north fighting the anarchical bandits, we have a unique chance to ambush the raiders in the south to help the corporation.

 YFC_event.8.desc: "It had only been a week since checkpoint B had been set up along the 'supposed' borders between the Corporation and the Bandits. The day of the event was like any other, few refugees crossing, some arrests, and the random machine gun on an object. The day was wrapping up like any other... \n\nUntil, during the night, checkpoint B's guards spotted a mass amount of objects heading towards them. They claimed that there are 'open borders' and that the guards at the checkpoint had no real authority. After much heated shouting, a gunshot ran out which led to an open battle. They were not refugees, but were bandits. They tried to storm the checkpoint from the small number of guards protecting it. Despite all odds, the guards held the ground and made the Bandits pay for each step forward. Even after the checkpoint was taken, the guards fell back inland and kept the fight on. One interesting report was that a squad of 8 held up in a cabin, lead by Jonas Taylor, fought off a force of around 100 objects and only lost 3 objects in the five hours of fighting. \n\nNight became day with the engagements only heating up. With the help of reinforcements, the combined forces pushed back the Bandits back to the checkpoint. Only when nightfall arrived that the Bandits retreated from the checkpoint. The checkpoint was retaken the next day. Many of the Objects that took part in the engagement have earned medals for their bravery. The overall death toll is being accounted for, but both soldiers and civilians were harmed in the fighting. No response has come from anyone in the Bandit lands. "

 YFC_event.9.desc: "With the idea of training settled, it was time to pick a location to train our soldiers. The perfect spot was found in a village in the hills north of the Great Ridge with great cover and houses. After kicking out the villagers, it was converted into a training ground. From there, countless practice raids were done to build up our strength and strategies. Our soldiers got more inventive then less on following orders, murder then peace, and looting then not. After a few weeks, the village has turned into ruins with no life around. However, one thing did come from these ruins..."

 YFC_event.10.desc: "Now... now is the time to begin our raiding efforts! With more objects in both the countryside and cities being 'hired' we have the ability to begin our raids. We must now use our raiding to not only survive, but to thrive! We need to steal the resources from our neighbors to gather even more strength, wealth, and power!. Sure, this land will fall into a land of anarchy and banditry, but it is a fair price!"

 YFC_event.11.t: "How Much?"
 YFC_event.11.desc: "It is no surprise that the large sums of money that Eraser managed to stockpile in his months as a plunderer could be useful for our industrialization efforts, however, many of our sectorial leaders have been in open debate about the exact amount needed.

 YFC_event.13.desc: "It was a very, very long trial over Eraser's fate. The sectors had heated debates over the pros and cons of any of the options we could do. Honestly the amount of these 'heated' debates have been getting concerning. Anyways, a few hours ago most finally agreed on his fate. This said fate was read out to him in his cell, it said the following... \n\n'Eraser, leader of the defunct anarchist Bunch, you have been given the following sentence for your crimes against the Yellow Face Company and their allies...'"

The air in our conference room? Besides, this wealth will have a much better use than laying around for anarchist use.\n\nA week after the very obvious outcome of the vote, Blocky entered the warehouse holding the money.

 YFC_event.22.desc.a: "Ah, Peoniele. \nHer flowers and meadows, tranquil and alone, have seen a small amount of trampling from the objects, moving lumber into the town square, and the vans, housing cement and other building goods. Peoniele's natural beauty is one of the things most treasured by the city's population, some of them are even protesting us building here at all. But, profits are to be made, and bigger buildings for more jobs certainly correlate with higher per capita incomes. Incomes which will be siphoned to us, of course. In the mean time, let us decide how big should we go here." 
 YFC_event.22.desc.b: "Strangely, Yoyleton's small teardropper population has been essential in helping us with our current tasks. We've been working on adding a couple of water features to the city, to attract tourism (we say it's to make life easier for them), and they've been giving great pointers to our engineers and architects who are... less versed... in building with water. Despite the pay cuts we need to issue, things seem to be going well. However, after we're done with the water features, how much bigger should this city be?"

 YFC_borderwars.3.t: "A Succesful Defense!"
 YFC_borderwars.3.desc: "The raiders came in the night, late at night at that. Nearly no one was awake, and from far outside the city limits we heard loud shouting. Suddenly, there was a gunshot, and it felt as if the whole city woke at the same time. Objects wandered outside of their houses, 'What was that?'s and 'I've got work in the morning.'s softly flying through the air. Suddenly, a soldier of ours bursted out of a room, soon a hundred more followed, then a thousand, then two thousand. It had turned from a typical night to an all out battle. The raiders fought hard, burning our buildings, killing our people, breaking equipment. We fought harder, maiming the raiders, stealing their own guns from them, burning them alive. \nIt was barbaric, sure, but in the end we won. We defended ourselves. We made examples out of them."

 YFC_borderwars.11.desc: "Our forces were able to overwhelm the guards at the work camp and freed the objects being held there. Many escaped with our forces and joined our ranks.

 YFC_borderwars.15.t: "Robbery gone wrong!"
 YFC_borderwars.15.desc: "As our forces entered the station, they were ambushed by both soldiers and police. It was clear that the administration was ready for our entry and brought forces.

 YFC_BUN.1.desc: "It has been a few weeks since Eraser and his gang of bandits were defeated and captured. Most capital stored in camps and buildings have been looted and taken to our capital. For us, the main threat is now gone.\n\nOr is it...? \n\nShockingly, the small population is not happy with our occupation and maintaining control is hard. Some in Yoyleton say that the company 'isn't cut out for this government stuff'. It does not help that the majority of the bandits were unfortunately not captured by our forces. Discussions have been going on in those said weeks over what to do with our occupied lands. Some say that we rightfully earned the former-Bunchivist land, and should take it for ourselves, while others want to try to make an ally out of the enemy. However, debates quickly became heated when Numismatia sent us telegram, with which they requested our outlook on what should be done with the former Bunch lands. With much 'polite' banter being thrown around at sectorial discussion tables and the like, it is now clear what we shall do."

 YFC_BUN.2.t: "Already Broken?"

It seems that Yellow Face wishes to take the route of annexation, as they believe that former Bunchivists are not trustworthy. While the message states nothing about our occupation zone, there is a fair chance that they will take our piece of the proverbial pie one way or another. \n\nThis seems to be quite bad, not only potentially losing our occupation, but for the regular every day people who lived in the Bunch, or for the former raiders who wished for reform. However, we do have one trick up our sleeves, one way to get things to pan out properly. Neo-Bunchivist revolts. We could support them and forcefully create a new, free state in former Bunch territory, but it could break what is now an uneasy alliance. After much discussion with a tied vote, Credit Card broke the tie with..."

 YFC_BUN.5.t: "Pen's Escape."
 YFC_BUN.5.desc: "Pen tried to keep a clear head as he tossed and turned in the ditch-turned-hideout he'd constructed a few hours before night fell. Following the end of the Bunch, the imprisonment of Him and Eraser, and whatever they'd done to Blocky, Pen started planning. Planning for the day he would have to run away from it all. It was proving much more difficult than he'd thought it would've. The ground was cold and wet, stained with the rain that'd fallen earlier.\nHe chose today to run away, because today was the day that he was thrown out of he and Eraser's cell. The corporate hacks clearly intended to take him somewhere afterward, but they'd left the hallway unattended for a couple moments too long after throwing him out. Eraser and Pen had been sharing the cell for the past few weeks, being taken as prisoners of war. Eraser was a goner, they'd both known that, but Pen had a chance. Anywhere Eraser would try to flee to, he'd be denied entry for being the leader of the Bunch. But Pen could lie. He could make up a story about being forced into it, because he had never been a prominent figure. He could say he was manipulated, he could say it was peer pressure, he could say Blocky and Eraser were never his *real* friends. He could say he hadn't worked with them at all, and he'd be believed. \nThoughts of the lies he'd have to tell, the ways he'd have to betray his friends, caused another toss. Him and Eraser had bonded in that cell, gotten a lot closer than they had before. Lots of words were shared, the hardest ones being the goodbyes...\n\nThinking about it more would make his head hurt. He should try and sleep."

 YFC_BUN.6.t: "Pen's Safety."
 YFC_BUN.6.desc: "He knew he could be safe in the Goiky Technocratic Republic. Tennis Ball had escaped there some weeks ago. Maybe some months now. He and Tennis Ball had bonded well in their time working together, though. Before Tennis Ball had fled the Bunch, he worked with them. Tennis Ball would lie for Pen. Tennis Ball was a good friend. Pen had to believe that, it was the only way he could stay sane.\nEver since that night in the ditch, he promised himself that he'd never try to sleep outside again. Recently, he'd been sleeping where ever a Bunchivist sympathizer had an open bed. He was often let in with open arms by the first door he knocked on, which was nice. Now though, he had to leave. \nYesterday, or maybe this morning? He couldn't remember. Earlier, he'd seen a newspaper with his image on the front of it. He never read what it said, but he could guess why they were printing him. He'd been running ever since. He surprisingly remembered how to get to Greenville on foot, despite how far away it was, and how little landmarks there were. Afterward, he could run straight east, and get to the Goiky Technocratic Republic. Salvation! He felt himself getting closer now. Surely the city would have as many sympathizers as Podgornyv did. Room and board for one night, and tomorrow he would be accross the border."
 YFC_BUN.6.a: "'They check their backs, but never their fronts.'"

 YFC_BUN.7.t: "Pen's Execution."
 YFC_BUN.7.desc: "He was on a train. He didn't even know they had those all the way in Greenville. Though, one 'Pipe' was the one driving it. Pipe was supposedly the leader of a 'RailRoad Sector', and they called themselves a 'Sectorial'.This meant nothing to Pen, except that they were with the Yellow Face Corporation.\nLast night, Pen entered Greenville and was greeted by Yellow Facer law inforcement. After putting him in cuffs, and threatening to shoot him if he made a single sound, they put him in a box and paraded him around town for a little while. The residents, some of which he'd spoken to personally, back when the Bunch was still a thing, didn't say anything. They watched him, with looks of fear and horror on their faces, some with complacency. The rest of the night was a haze. A rioter showing up, then more, then gunshots, blood. It was harder to remember last night than it was to listen to the sounds of the train moving along its tracks, so thats what he did instead.\n\nAfter around an hour, Pen got bored. \n'So, where are you taking me?' He didn't really expect a response. \nPipe looked back over their shoulder. 'Besides Podgornyv, I don't know. I'd tell you if I could.' The response shocked Pen. Not only was Pipe actually speaking to him, they were being respectful. Benevolent, even.\nPen decided to try his luck with another question. 'Why am I being hunted? I haven't even done much wrong, I swear!'. Pipe turned again, another quick response. 'Not only were you working closely, *very* closely with Eraser, you are some $500 Million Vigintillion in debt to us.' \nThe rest of Pen's train ride continued in silence. Of course this was about money.\n\nA few hours later, and they were back in Podgornyv. Pen had actually been sitting inside some waiting room for a while before now. They let him out just a little while ago, ushering him to some random location in the middle of the once beautiful, now ruined city. When they finished transporting him, he was standing on a stage. Three armed objects behind him, and a crowd in front. It felt like the whole world was standing around him, watching as he stood. The Podgornyv populace watched as Yellow Face read off a long, often repeating, list of crimes and accusations against Pen, many of which hadn't even been illegal in Old Goiky. There was assault, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, treason -- against who he didn't know -- inciting a riot, attempting to evade arrest. Pen couldn't bring himself to care anymore, he knew he was going to die. \nIt's strange, really, how the red block behind him took a good look at his hands before shooting."
 YFC_BUN.7.a: "'You never amounted to anything anyways.'"

 YFC_BUN.8.t: "A Rematch!"
 YFC_BUN.8.desc: "The riots got too large. Way larger than we could ever handle with a police force. Not even the military could push back the rioters at first, or the 'Neo-Bunchivists' as they call themselves. Not really 'neo' if your predecessor existed less than a few years ago. Regardless, They've taken control of the outskirts of Podgornyv, and, at this point, we can't hold them back with what we have. Additionally, Coiny and his men are dealing with larger events, and we won't be able to get ahold of them without large sums of money. Not to mention the travel times. So we'll have to rely on the Military Sector and our Mercenaries.\nThe Bandits, despite their combined efforts, aren't just attacking us, they're attacking the combined system of capitalism.

 YFC_BUN.9.desc: "We are, certainly, dealing with a beastly people. The raiders, with anti-capitalist styles of living, need to be contained. With containment, comes law inforcement (private, obviously), and with law inforcement, comes a man to rule them all. Or a woman, really whoever has the best prospects (or pays the most). This obvious realization leads us to the question of who shall become this ruler. Whereas with our law inforcement, we can get any sad sap from Footpathburg, Yoyleton, or otherwise, we have to choose carefully when picking the leader. So, who shall it be?"
 YFC_BUN.9.a: "Head of the Company, Head of the zone!"

 YFC_BUN.9.c: "Br- I mean, 'hire' a local official."

 YFC_BUN.10.t: "Monopolies?"
 YFC_BUN.10.desc: "An... interesting question... came up in discussions today. Some of the sectorials, namely Pipe and Hammer, were asking about setting up permanent operations in Bunch. Much money is to be made, but what about the local stores inside Bunch? A suggestion was to integrate the small business with our sectors. Is the potential anger from the population worth it...?"
 YFC_BUN.10.a: "MONEY!!!!!"
 YFC_BUN.10.b: "Integration helps both us and them."
 YFC_BUN.10.c: "It's not worth the anger..."

 YFC_BUN.11.t: "Issue of Security"
 YFC_BUN.11.desc: "Controlling these lands has been... more complicated than expected. Minor violent engagements have been popping up more and more accross our occupation zone. There were discussions today in a meeting that the sectorial leaders all attended. This issue also came up, and when it did, a fierce debate started seemingly out of nowhere. Top Hat suggested increasing the amount of forces in our occupation zone, which would be costly. Taser suggested recruiting locals, which require training and time. Beaker stated that any options are costly and useless, which doesn't really address the underlying issue. Who had really been correct, was the question by the end of the meeting."
 YFC_BUN.11.a: "Top Hat is right."
 YFC_BUN.11.b: "Go with Taser's idea."
 YFC_BUN.11.c: "Beaker's is the logical choice."

 YFC_BUN.12.t: "Sparks Emit"
 YFC_BUN.12.desc: "Podgornyv is basically in flames at this point. There had been demonstrations earlier, but today has been especially out of hand. Chaos is growing in the streets, security forces in hours long standoffs with the so called 'Neo-Bunchivists'. Their demands are simple, autonomy in our nation, and making theft legal in formerly bunchivist lands. Not a single sectorial doesnt detest this idea, but, giving into the demands would stop the protests, right? If we give in, we may not be popular with the good people over in Footpathburg, but it could be worth it to give in to stop the brewing revolt."
 YFC_BUN.12.a: "What happens in the Bunch stays in the Bunch, give in."

 YFC_BUN.12.c: "The protests will fade away, just do nothing..."

 YFC_BUN.13.t: "Blocky's current position."
 YFC_BUN.13.desc: "So, Blocky. He's been doing some minor tasks for us for some time. Granted, his future inside the company has never really been questioned. Not to say he's useless, just that the whole dealing with the annexation has been more of a focus for us then him. A few days ago, the question came up in discussions over very minor and frankly boring things. That question has been the center of talks now, and a few really good ideas have been brought up. What is the fate of this ex-Bunchivist turned ally?"
 YFC_BUN.13.a: "A Political Advisor!"
 YFC_BUN.13.b: "A General!"
 YFC_BUN.13.c: "The face of pro-annexation!"

 YFC_BUN.14.t: "An Equal?"
 YFC_BUN.14.desc: "'How would the occupation zone fit into our nation's structure?' asked Beaker in, you guessed it, another day of discussions and meetings. It was a good question, as the sectors wanted different things. Capitalism will likely die before all of our sectorials agree on something. Top Hat and Hammer wanted it to be more of a colony compared to the other cities and the like comprising our current nation, Beaker and Pipe wanted a fully integrated state, however, Beaker said that, despite its status of full integration, it should sitll be partfully autonomous. So what will it be...?"
 YFC_BUN.14.a: "A colony!"
 YFC_BUN.14.b: "An integrated state!"
 YFC_BUN.14.c: "An autonomous state!"

 YFC_BUN.15.t: "Words on Paper..."
 YFC_BUN.15.desc: "A major engagement broke out today between Top Hat's security forces and Bunchivist terrorists. It was the largest to date, rivaling that of even some of the battles in the war. It took place in some farmlands near Taptop with most of the area being set ablaze. Nothing out of the ordinary besides the scale, however the events before the engagement are what was interesting to higher command. Reports from local civilians and even security forces state that Top Hat's men opted to raid one of the barns, then an argument broke out. The argument turned to small scuffles, which turned to fights, and now, we're here.\nMany Neo-Bunchivist demonstrators are calling us hypocrites. Our war agains the Bunch was purely justified based on the fact that they were raiders, and now our private police are doing the same thing as them.\nWhat we could do is... sweep it under the rug... Top Hat did say it was likely that his sector would no longer have any foreign support if something like this got out, since all Bunchivists involved were civillians. While bad, this could curve some of the growing influence that the military sector had been getting... our pick?"
 YFC_BUN.15.a: "Blame the whole event on Top Hat."

At this rate, if things don't get better, we may have much more problems...\n\nThose were our thoughts this morning. \nThis afternoon, we discovered that some of the profit and expense numbers from one of our sectors were miscalculated, and that we have a surplus of funds waiting to be used."

However, we've seen what they've been doing to the Neo-Bunchivists in their side of the occupation, and it, to put it simply, is inobjane. Supporting the Yellow Facers in their ventures to 'cleanse' the lands of raiders is to go against the very ideals of our nation. However, with the amount of money they support us with..."

During the night a few days ago, around 10 to 25 objects entered the small industrial district of Podgornyv and started planting explosives on the factories. However, these objects must have lacked the knowledge that a patrol was wandering in the area who noticed the terrorist attack being set up. Screaming matches became gunshots as a small engagement broke out. The small, underequipped group was no match for our forces. However, only one factory was able to be saved in the chaos. The rest of the factories were blown to pieces. Luckily, everyone that was important was evacuated and our security forces took no losses. Only one object was captured, who had no information that he was willing to give up."

Apparently, the Yellow Facers are seeking to have a deeper integration, possibly even a union, between our two nations. This raises a couple of concerns, seeing how they're also working closely with Eraser's Bunch. Many in our nation would already be opposed to this idea, seeing who the Yellow Facers are collaborating with, however, this is also quite an interesting opportunity. They've stated that we could work out the terms of this agreement through the mail, and are looking forward to our response. This seems quite out of the ordinary for any mail The Bunch might've sent, so it was clearly written by our friends over at the corporation."

After many hours, we decided to issue them a demand in regards to the army. \nOur military sector, unsurprisingly, stands alone on their opinion in this issue, believing that the Numismatian army should be integrated into ours, and forced to learn raiding strategies. Top Hat, the leader of the sector, spoke about this passionately, saying that standard military techniques proved to be ineffective in the modern world, and that a disjounted military is an encircled one. \nDespite his speech, every other sectorial disagreed with him. Pipe, the Railroad sectorial, who had always been a pacifist, vehemently disagreed with this idea. They said that any attempt at forcing a nation into signing away their military was sure to end in disaster. They claimed that we should have separate, but equal militaries, where generals from both sides convine and have to come to agreements together. The debate lasted a little longer, with some insults being thrown about. However, we managed to reach a decision."

The whole agreement was worded quite unclearly, and some of the more important information was left out. It's easy to fill in the blanks, but the wording alone made some of our cabinet suspicious of the demand. Regardless, it doesn't seem like a bad idea at all, and the ending section about our militaries coming together to agree on decisions before putting them into place was especially popular among the cabinet.

Strangely, Eraser sent us a letter, wishing to know our intentions in terms of civil liberties. It was a surprise to the cabinet when they recieved word of this demand, seeing as they had somehow managed to gloss over a discussion of personal freedoms entirely. Eraser's message stated that a response would be passed on to the Yellow Facers, so it's as good of a time as ever to write our own set of demands. \nWe obviously believe that life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness should be available, but should stricter guidelines be set?"

The demands in the message aren't anything we didn't expect them to bring up, though. They simply wish for some rights to be protected.

This led to confusing battles where soldiers and civilians fought over the ruined streets. The most heated engagement came around the government building where it was blown to pieces by the invading attackers. Ice Cube is reported to have fled before the fall of the government building around [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], citing that 'revenge will come'.

The defenders had prepared to defend their homes with obstacles, strong points, and traps inside the city. The fighting was fierce and deadly with each house costing more blood to capture. However, the preparations were not enough to withstand the waves of attackers and were soon pushed into only a few key sections of the city. One of the last points to fall was the Recommended Characters Council, where the defenders fought to the very last object. The government itself is nowhere to be seen, but is believed to have fled."
